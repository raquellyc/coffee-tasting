            1. heat the water until its boiling and allow it to cool for approximately 30 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            2. Grind coffee to a coarseness resembling sea salt. For blends, we recommend using 30 grams of coffee.<br>
            <br>
            3. Place a filter in the dripper. It is recommend wetting the filter with hot water and then dumping the water before proceeding with brewing.<br>
            <br>
            4. Add the ground coffee to the filter and gently tap it to level the surface of the grounds.<br>
            <br>
            5. There will be four pours total for this coffee preparation. This is the first, and the most magical, because it is when you will see the coffee “bloom.” As hot water first hits the grounds, Co2 is released creating a blossoming effect—the grounds will rise up en masse.<br>
            Start a timer. Begin pouring water slowly over the coffee, starting at the outer rim and moving in a steady spiral toward the center of the grounds. Stop pouring when the scale reaches 60 grams. Make sure all the grounds are saturated, even if you need to add a little water. The pour should take about 15 seconds. Give the coffee an additional 30 seconds to drip before moving on to the second pour.<br>
            <br>
            6. Starting in the center of the grounds, pour in a steady spiral toward the outer edge and then back toward the center. Be sure to pour all the way out to the edge over the ripples in the filter. This helps to keep grounds from being trapped in there and removed from the rest of the extraction. Add roughly 90 grams, bringing the total to 150 grams. The goal during this pour is to sink all of the grounds on the surface of the bed. This creates a gentle turbulence that “stirs” the coffee, allowing water to more evenly extract the grounds. Allow 45–65 seconds to elapse.<br>
            <br>
            7. As the mixture of water and coffee from the second pour drops to the bottom of the filter, coming close to the level of the grounds, pour an additional 100 grams of water using the same pattern as the second pour. This brings the total up to 250 grams and should take 15–20 seconds.<br>
            <br>
            8. When the water and coffee from the third pour drops to the bottom of the filter, complete your fourth and final pour. Add 100 grams, bringing the total up to 350 grams of water. This pour should take 20 seconds.<br>

          FRENCH PRESS:
          <br>
         1. Preheat the french press coffee maker by pouring in some hot water.<br>
         <br>
         2. Weigh your coffee - standard measurement is 8 g of coffee grounds to 4 ounces of water.<br>
         <br>
         3. Boil your water.<br>
         <br>
         4. Grind the beans after measuring them out.<br>
         <br>
         5. Add ground coffee to the Bodum french press after dumping out the warming water.<br>
         <br>
         6. Add boiling water to coffee grounds and use stirring spoon to stir.<br>
         <br>
         7. Set a timer for 4 minutes and relax while you wait.<br>
         <br>
         8. Slowly push down on the plunger until it hits the bottom.<br>
         <br>
         9. Pour your fresh french press coffee into your favorite mug and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee.<br>
         <br>
         10. Don’t let the coffee sit in the french press too long because it will burn and become bitter.<br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         AERO PRESS:
         <br>
         1.  measure out 2.5 tablespoons, or one very-full Aeropress scoop (a full scoop is about 16 grams) grind your
         coffee beans until they're medium-fine.<br>
         <br>
         2. Place the filter inside of the Aeropress cap, and use boiling water to wash out the filter and wet your Aeropress.
         Don't forget to throw out the water before brewing!<br>
         <br>
         3. heat the water until its boiling and allow it to cool for approximately 30 seconds.<br>
         <br>
         4. Ensuring the brew chamber of the Aeropress is placed securely on top your mug, go ahead and add the coffee. 
         Shake chamber to level your grounds.<br>
         <br>
         5. Add your hot water with the aim to fill your chamber within 10 seconds. Twist the chamber as pour, this will ensure you wet your grounds evenly.
         Add water up to or above the number 4 on the Aeropress chamber. <br>
         <br>
         6. Give the coffee slurry a quick stir. Insert the Aeropress plunger into the chamber at a slight angle, then straighten it up and pull it out slightly to create a vacuum seal.
         Set your timer and wait for 1 minute.<br>
         <br>
         7. Remove your pressure seal and give the whole thing another stir. Insert the plunger back into the chamber and slowly begin to press. Aim to push the plunger down fully over the course of 1 minute.
         You’ll know when your coffee is brewed when you hear a hissing sound, indicating that there's no water left in the AeroPress to push through.<br>
         <br>
         8. If you feel it needs it, add more water. You should be aware the AeroPress produces a pretty strong tasting cup of Coffee.<br>
         <br>
         9. The best way to clean your AeroPress is to unscrew the cap and push the plunger until both the filter and coffee grounds pop out. The harder you push, the more satisfying it will be. If you’re brewing another cup,
         your Aeropress is pre heated and ready to go.<br>

        <div class="tab-content">
           <br>
           1. In order to get the best out of your espresso maker, you’ll need to ensure that the entire machine is preheated. This can take up to 25 minutes for some machines, so get your machine warming up in advance!<br>
           <br>
           2. Set your grinder to a fine grind size, and place coffee in your portafiller basket. Use your hand to shave away the excess coffee, push it into the nooks and crannies and smooth it down so you can start applying pressure with your tamper (next step).<br>
           <br>
           3. You’ll want your beans roughly evenly distributed before tamping. This can be accomplished by lightly tapping the side of the portafilter with your hand, or even by leveling the espresso grounds off with the side of your finger.
           Once you’ve done that it’s time to get tamping. The key to tamping well is to press down straight – you do not want to have an uneven puck. You’ll want to use a fair bit of pressure her, although the age-old wisdom of 30lbs of pressure is probably overkill.
           A good rule to follow is tamp until the grounds stop settling.<br>
           <br>
           4.While you pull this shot, time how long it takes to hit 2 ounces (the typical size of a double shot). Ideally, you’ll end up between 20 and 30 seconds per pull.
           If you’re in this range then technically are done, you’ve made espresso. Hopefully it is rich and dark and sweet and glorious. But, the reality is that this first shot is just establishing a baseline.<br>
           <br>
           5. If your espresso pulled too quickly you’ll want to change to a finer grind. Conversely, if your espresso took an eternity to pull you’ll want a coarser grind. Then you can prepare again.<br>
           <br>
           6. At this stage you decide whether you want to enjoy the espresso pure, like an Italian, or turn it into a milk based coffee. If the latter is the case, it’s time to work on the milk.<br>
           <br>
           <br>
           STEAMING MILK:
           <br>
           If you’re making a latte, a macchiato, a cortado, or a cortadito then the next step for you would be milk steaming. Hopefully your machine has a steam wand built in. If not, you’ll have to use a separate milk steamer to steam your milk<br>
           <br>
           Using your machines steam wand – Start out with cold milk poured into your stainless steel milk pitcher. Turn on your steamer wand briefly to eliminate any condensation that may have accumulated in the wand.
           Next, put the steamer wand tip below the surface of the milk. Turn on your steamer and froth the milk until it reaches your desired consistency. Be sure to keep the steamer wand just below the surface during this process.
           Once you’ve reached the frothiness you want, plunge the tip to the bottom of your milk vessel and continue steaming until you reach your desired temperature. Wipe your wand down and give it a brief purge to keep things sanitary.<br>
           <br>
           The key to foaming your milk is heat. Too little and your foam won’t stay together, too much and your milk will taste burnt and unpleasant. Practice practice practice and you’ll get a feel for it.<br>

            1. Separate your stovetop espresso maker into its three parts: The lower portion for the water, The filter for the coffee grounds,
            The upper chamber for the finished coffee.<br>
            <br>
            2. Grind the coffee on a fairly coarse setting. (if the grounds are too fine it can leak and cause issues.)<br>
            <br>
            3. Fill the lower part of your stovetop espresso coffee maker chamber with cold, filtered water. Don’t fill past the safety valve!<br>
            <br>
            4. Take the filter basket and fill it all the way with coffee grounds. Make sure it is full!<br>
            <br>
            5. You're almost ready to make your Moka coffee! All that’s left is to put your stovetop espresso maker back together.
            First, place the filter back into the water-filled lower part of the unit. Then screw the top part on well.<br>
            <br>
            6.  Place your stovetop espresso maker on the stovetop, turn on the stove, and wait for the water to come to a boil.
            Most units are fairly small, so this process shouldn’t take long.<br>
            <br>
            7. When you hear a gurgling sound, that’s the cue that the water has made the short, hot trip north and has filled 
            the upper chamber with some delicious coffee. Once you hear gurgling, remove the maker from the stove and pour! Now Enjoy!<br>

           1. Prep the filter Pull the chain of the metal filter attachment down and sink it. The clip attaches at the bottom of the funnel.<br>
           <br>
           2. Add water: Use pre-heated water to make things move a lot quicker when brewing. Make sure the outside of the globe is completely dry before you apply heat to prevent it from cracking.
           Fill the globe to the No. 5 mark.<br>
           <br>
           3. Vac pots usually come with a candle burner, but a butane burner (shown here) is much more effective. Turn the burner on and up high. Loosely place the funnel inside the globe so it sits at an angle while you wait for the water to boil—boil times vary.<br>
           <br>
           4. Measure out 40 grams (about 6 Tablespoons) of coffee. Grind coffee to a medium coarseness or about as fine as table salt.<br>
           <br>
           5. Once the water starts to boil, attach the top funnel securely to the globe.<br>
           <br>
           6. When the top assembly fills (you’ll want a little water remaining in the globe), create a whirlpool and add the coffee directly into the water. Start a count-up timer.<br>
           <br>
           7. Adjust your burner to lower the flame. Give the mixture a stir, immersing the coffee completely. At :40 seconds, stir it again. This second stir is more of a gentle fold, making sure everything is completely saturated.<br>
           <br>
           8.  At 1:30, turn the heat off completely and give it a big swirl. Wait for the coffee to draw down through the filter into the globe, which should be finished at approximately 3:00.<br>
           <br>
           9. Place the top funnel in the black base and remove the globe from the stand. You might want to use hot pads or a kitchen towel.<br>

           <br>
           2. Add water use a 1:2 coffee to water ratio, or 1 1/2 cups of grounds for every 3 cups of water. then stir.<br>
           <br>
           3. Cover and set aside for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature. The longer the coffee steeps, the stronger it will be.<br>
           <br>
           4. Spread a piece of cheesecloth in a fine mesh strainer and place it over a large bowl. Pour the coffee into the bowl to strain it. Store the strained coffee in the fridge.<br>
           <br>
           5. When ready to serve, pour over ice and add milk, if desired and enjoy!<br>
